# RF Mechanics

Initial baseline **1.0.0** for Vintage Story **1.22.6**. Live gameplay acceptance is still pending; expect bugs and balance changes.

**Summary:** Race-specific abilities and survival mechanics, from elven climbing and dwarven Ore-Song to Orc Thew and goblin scavenging.

### Development and AI use

**I've been a developer for about five years, and for the last two years I've worked closely with advanced AI models.** C# is a language I have much less experience with, so I use LLM coding tools to supplement my knowledge of the language and Vintage Story's modding API.

That includes generating and explaining code, researching implementation options, investigating errors and helping with documentation. AI has a substantial role in this project's development. I choose what goes into the mod, playtest as development progresses, and handle release decisions and maintenance. That does not mean every situation has been tested. The source is available for anyone who wants to inspect it, contribute or make their own version.

### What it does

RF Mechanics is the gameplay companion to Race Framework. It gives races different ways to explore, gather and survive.

- **Dwarves:** mining bonuses that vary with depth, plus **Ore-Song**. Sit beside stone or ore, empty your main hand, and press Race Ability (default C) while aiming at a wall within two blocks. Settle, knock, and listen for distant mineral voices with broad directional cues. Standing or moving ends the listen. Placed ore sings too.
- **Elves:** climb trees, move through branchy leaves and use focused vision to look into the distance.
- **Orcs:** maintain **Thew** through feeding, with changes to body size and physical capabilities. Frenzy offers a burst of power with recovery costs. Use scent to help locate creatures; standing still builds a clearer sense.
- **Goblins:** small, nimble scavengers whose size helps them explore cramped spaces. Use spit to help collect materials from ruins, with darkvision and scavenging bonuses supporting the playstyle. Eating rot also builds an aura that accelerates nearby food spoilage; abstaining lets it fade. Flies provide feedback for the aura and stored spit charges.

Mechanics and balance values are configurable. Development is ongoing, and feedback on how the races feel to play is welcome.

### Installation

For the standard setup, install Race Framework and its dependencies, then RF Mechanics on both server and client. Mechanics activate through the relevant race traits. Look for the race ability binding in the game's Controls menu.

Diet Setup is an optional companion for race-specific food rules.

### Existing worlds — untested

I have not tested adding this mod to an existing world. No new-world requirement is currently known, but compatibility is not guaranteed.

**Installing on an existing save is at your own risk. I am not responsible for problems, lost progress or save damage resulting from doing so.** Make a full backup and test on a separate copy first. Keep the original backup: removing the mod does not necessarily undo saved changes.

RF Mechanics saves character state and can change food freshness and repaired objects. Uninstalling does not restore those changes. Custom blocks already present in a save also depend on the mod's definitions.

### Ideas for future updates

These are directions I would like to explore, subject to design work and playtesting:

- **Goblin reclamation:** recovering useful parts from worn-out tools, damaged objects and picked-over ruins.
- **Dwarven hearths and feasts:** making settled homes and shared meals part of dwarven life.
- **Elven cultivation:** selecting and growing plants across generations.
- **Gnomish mechanisms:** compact devices, traps, timers and controls.
- **Life around water:** wetlands and fishing for Frogs; diving and underwater exploration for Merpeople.
- **Dragon-kin windworks:** capturing wind power and building around exposed terrain.

These are not features in the current download or promises for the next update. More work on existing mechanics will continue alongside new features and races.
